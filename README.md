# Golang_Fiber_Auth0
This template can be used to start up a project using Golang Fiber as a web framework and Auth0 as your authentication service

I wanted to learn Auth0 and Fiber is my go to golang web framework, unfortunately Auth0's tutorial is based on Gin. So I decided to recreate the start up project using fiber. If you like it go ahead and give it a star and if anything needs to be changed just let me know.
